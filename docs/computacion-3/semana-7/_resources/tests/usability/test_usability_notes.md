1. **Hesitation Points**: Where do users pause or seem uncertain?
2. **Misinterpretations**: Which questions or recommendations are misunderstood?
3. **Body Language**: Signs of frustration, confusion, or satisfaction
4. **Questions Asked**: What clarifications do participants need?
5. **Response to Results**: Initial reaction to the system's recommendation

## Semi-structured Interview Questions

After completing tasks and questionnaires, ask:

1. What did you find most useful about the system?
2. What aspects of the system were most confusing?
3. How would you compare this to how you normally make betting decisions?
4. What additional information would have made the recommendations more helpful?
5. How confident would you feel making a bet based on this system's recommendation?
6. Which factors do you think influenced the recommendation the most?
7. What would make the explanation of the recommendation clearer?
8. Would you use this system in real-life betting scenarios? Why or why not?
