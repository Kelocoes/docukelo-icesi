# Project Report: Expert System for Sports Betting Advice

## **Introduction**

In an era where Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to transform decision-making processes across industries, the field of sports betting remains one of high uncertainty and emotional bias. While many enthusiasts rely heavily on instinct or superficial data, advanced systems that integrate statistical inference and symbolic reasoning offer a significant edge. This project presents the design and implementation of a medium-complexity expert system that provides betting advice for football (soccer) and basketball events. The system uses both rule-based logic via the Experta library and probabilistic modeling through Bayesian networks built with pgmpy.

The application is delivered through an interactive chatbot interface, allowing users to answer contextual questions about upcoming matches. The system then evaluates whether placing a bet is likely to be a “safe” or “risky” decision and justifies its recommendation through an interpretable explanation. The system aims to bridge intuitive user interaction with sophisticated reasoning under uncertainty.

## **Problem Statement and Objectives**

### **Problem Statement**

Sports betting attracts millions of participants globally, yet many rely on emotion or incomplete information. While historical statistics and expert intuition offer partial guidance, there exists a gap in tools that can formalize these insights into actionable recommendations. Moreover, most casual bettors lack the statistical or domain expertise to integrate multiple event factors meaningfully.

### **Objectives**

* To develop an intelligent agent that assists users in making informed sports betting decisions.
* To integrate symbolic rule-based systems (Experta) with probabilistic reasoning (pgmpy) for evaluating the likelihood of betting outcomes.
* To implement an explainable recommendation mechanism that justifies its betting risk evaluation.
* To design a user-friendly, web-based interface that simulates a natural dialogue.

## **Requirements Analysis**

### **Functional Scope**

* The system must provide betting recommendations for two sports: soccer and basketball.
* It must collect user input interactively via a chatbot-style interface.
* The system must evaluate whether a betting scenario is “safe” or “risky”.
* It must explain the rationale behind its recommendation based on a combination of factors.

### **User Interface**

* A chatbot interface that allows users to select a sport and answer questions about the match.
* The interface should be intuitive, with clear prompts and feedback.
* The system should handle invalid inputs gracefully, prompting the user to re-enter information.

### **Risk Assessment Criteria**

* The “safety” of a bet is defined probabilistically based on variable influence weights derived from domain rules and intuitive heuristics (e.g., poor form and injuries increase risk).

## **Knowledge Acquisition and Representation**

### **Sources of Knowledge**

* Betting guides and expert heuristics were used to establish IF-THEN rules (e.g., "If team form is poor AND the match is away, THEN increase risk").
* Probabilistic weights and state mappings were defined for all variables, enabling Bayesian modeling of their influence. They were derived from historical match data manily from Keagle databases.

### **Knowledge Representation**

#### **Rule-Based System (Experta)**

* Each sport has its own `Expert` class (`BasketballExpert`, `SoccerExpert`), which inherits from a shared `BaseExpert`.
* Knowledge is encoded via declarative rules using Experta’s `@Rule` decorators, prompting users for missing facts and chaining through a decision tree.

```

#### **Bayesian Networks (pgmpy)**

* Conditional Probability Distributions (CPDs) model uncertainty in relationships between match variables and the output class (`bet_risk` or `risk`).
* State names and cardinalities are clearly defined.
* The final decision is computed using `VariableElimination` inference.

### **User Flow**

1. User selects a sport.
2. System loads the corresponding expert model and Bayesian network.
3. System asks questions to gather all required variables.
4. Once all facts are collected:

   * The rule engine validates the inputs.
   * The Bayesian network computes the probability of a safe/risky bet.
   * The system explains the result based on both the input and probabilistic output.

## **Implementation Details**

### **Technologies Used**

* **Python 3.10**
* **Experta**: for encoding symbolic rules.
* **pgmpy**: for defining and querying Bayesian networks.
* **Flask**: lightweight web framework to serve frontend and backend.
* **HTML/CSS/JS + Bootstrap**: to build the chatbot interface.

## **Testing and Validation**

The betting advisory system underwent rigorous testing to ensure its functionality, performance, and accuracy. The testing strategy employed a multi-layered approach, evaluating both individual components and the integrated system.

### Types of Tests Performed

#### Unit Tests
Comprehensive unit tests were conducted to verify the behavior of individual system components. You can find the unit tests in the [`tests/unit/`](../tests/unit/) directory. The tests cover the following areas:

- **Expert Systems**: Tests for both basketball and soccer expert systems to ensure correct question flow, input validation, and rule application.
- **Bayesian Networks**: Tests for both basketball and soccer Bayesian networks to ensure correct probability calculations and inference behavior.

#### Integration Tests

Interactions between components were evaluated to ensure correct functioning of the integrated system. You can find the integration tests in the [`tests/integration/`](../tests/integration/) directory. The tests cover:

- **Expert System and Bayesian Network Integration**: Tests to ensure that the expert system correctly interacts with the Bayesian network, passing the right facts and receiving accurate risk evaluations.

- **User Interaction Flow**: Tests to verify that the user interface correctly collects inputs, displays questions, and shows final recommendations based on the expert system's output.

#### Stress and Performance Tests
Tests were conducted to evaluate system behavior under load, in order to evaluate the system's robustness, responsiveness, scalability, and reliability under various load conditions.

**1. Test Setup**

Two instances of the `BettingAdviser` were instantiated, one for basketball and one for soccer. Each test generates randomly generated match-related facts representing different scenarios across all variables defined for each sport. These facts serve as input for the expert system to generate betting advice.

**2. Volume Testing**

Volume tests process a large number of individual requests (default 100) with randomly generated facts for each sport. Each request measures the system's response time and verifies the presence of a valid advice message. The test implementation:

```python
def run_volume_test(self, sport, num_tests=100):
    """Run volume test with random facts"""
    for i in tqdm(range(num_tests)):
        if sport == "basketball":
            facts = self.generate_random_basketball_facts()
        else:
            facts = self.generate_random_soccer_facts()
            
        result = self.test_single_advice(sport, facts)
```

The primary goals are to:

* Assess the average and maximum response times under typical load
* Determine the success rate of producing valid advice
* Identify any errors occurring during processing
* Generate detailed logs for each request including response times, success status, and error messages

Results are exported in JSON format to [`volume_tests/`](../tests/stress/results/volume_tests/) directory for further analysis.

**3. Concurrency Testing**

Concurrency tests evaluate system performance under multiple simultaneous users making requests. The implementation uses Python's `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` to simulate concurrent user sessions:

```python
def run_concurrent_test(self, sport, concurrent_users=[2, 5, 10], requests_per_user=20):
    """Test system behavior under concurrent load"""
    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=num_users) as executor:
        future_to_user = {executor.submit(user_session, user_id): user_id 
                          for user_id in range(num_users)}
```

Each test configuration evaluates:

* Multiple concurrency levels (2, 5, 10 concurrent users by default)
* Each user makes multiple requests (20 by default)
* Measures total execution time, success rates, average response times, and throughput
* Generates comprehensive metrics including response time distributions

Results include visualizations showing:
- Success rate vs concurrent users
- Response time vs concurrent users  
- Throughput vs concurrent users
- Response time distribution for highest concurrency level

**4. Memory Usage Testing**

Memory usage tests monitor system memory consumption during extended operation to detect potential memory leaks or excessive resource usage:

```python
def run_memory_usage_test(self, sport, num_tests=200, sample_interval=10):
    """Monitor memory usage during extended testing"""
    process = psutil.Process()
    initial_memory = process.memory_info().rss / 1024 / 1024  # MB
    
    for i in tqdm(range(num_tests)):
        # Test advice request
        result = self.test_single_advice(sport, facts)
        
        # Sample memory usage at intervals
        if i % sample_interval == 0:
            current_memory = process.memory_info().rss / 1024 / 1024
            memory_samples.append({
                "test_number": i,
                "memory_usage_mb": current_memory,
                "memory_delta_mb": current_memory - initial_memory
            })
```

This test:
* Runs 200 requests by default with memory sampling every 10 tests
* Tracks initial, final, maximum, and average memory usage
* Calculates memory growth/reduction over time
* Generates visualizations of memory usage patterns and distributions

**5. Performance Reporting**

After completing all tests, a comprehensive performance report is generated using matplotlib visualizations. The report includes:

* **Response time distribution histograms** comparing both sports
* **Success rate comparison** between basketball and soccer
* **Error count analysis** across both domains
* **Detailed statistical metrics** including count, minimum, maximum, mean, median, and 95th percentile response times
* **Performance metrics export** in both CSV and JSON formats

The reporting system creates:
- Performance charts saved as PNG files
- Detailed statistics exported to CSV format
- Comprehensive metrics saved as JSON files
- All results consolidated in [`all_test_results.json`](../tests/stress/results/all_test_results.json)

#### Usability Tests
User experience with the system was evaluated:

- **Sample size**: 12 participants
- **Varied profiles**: Users with different levels of knowledge about sports betting
- **Structured tasks**: Predefined scenarios for basketball and soccer

> **Note:** This is explained more in detail at [test_usability_notes.md`](_resources\tests\usability\test_usability_notes.md).

#### Validation Tests
The validation tests aim to evaluate the predictive performance of the expert system for sports betting advice in football and basketball domains. Two datasets containing historical match results are used: one for soccer matches and another for basketball games.

For each sport, the system loads the corresponding dataset composed of individual match records, each including match attributes and the actual match outcome (e.g., home win or away win). The expert system processes each match’s contextual facts—excluding identifiers such as team names and dates—to generate a betting recommendation classified as either "safe" (`segura`) or "risky" (`arriesgada`).

The predicted classification is then compared against the real match outcome to assess correctness under the following criteria:

* A "safe" prediction is considered correct if the home team actually won.
* A "risky" prediction is deemed correct if the home team did not win.

The total number of matches, number of correct predictions, and overall prediction accuracy percentage are calculated and reported for each sport.

#### Testing Conclusions

#### Testing Conclusions

**Conclusions from the Volume Testing**

* **Success and Reliability**: Both soccer and basketball systems processed all 100 test requests with a **100% success rate** and no errors logged. This demonstrates that the recommendation generation logic is fully stable under moderate individual load.

* **Response Times**:
  * *Soccer*: Average response time was **3.5 seconds**, with a minimum of 3.42s and a maximum of 3.6s. The tight range indicates excellent consistency per request.
  * *Basketball*: Average response time was **0.76 seconds**, with a minimum of 0.71s and a maximum of 0.91s. This shows the basketball system is significantly faster, likely due to fewer variables and simpler logic.

**Conclusions from the Concurrency Testing**

* **Multi-User Performance**: Concurrency tests evaluated system behavior under 2, 5, and 10 simultaneous users, with each user making 20 requests:

  * *Soccer Concurrency*: The system maintained stable performance across all concurrency levels, with response times ranging from less than 10s to 35s. Success rates varied from 90.5% to 97.5% depending on concurrent load, with some timeout errors occurring at higher concurrency levels.
  
  * *Basketball Concurrency*: Response times ranged from less than 2s to 9s across different concurrency levels. Success rates were generally high (83.5-97.5%), with occasional timeouts under peak concurrent load.

* **Scalability Behavior**: The system demonstrates good horizontal scalability, maintaining functionality even with 10 concurrent users. However, response time variance increases with higher concurrency, indicating resource contention.

**Conclusions from the Memory Usage Testing**

* **Memory Efficiency**: Extended operation tests (200 requests with memory sampling every 10 tests) revealed excellent memory management:

  * *Basketball*: Memory usage remained stable around 368-369 MB throughout testing, with minimal growth (only -0.96 MB change from initial to final). No memory leaks detected.
  
  * *Soccer*: Initial memory usage of 380.8 MB decreased to 366.2 MB by test completion, showing a net reduction of -14.62 MB. This indicates efficient garbage collection and memory optimization.

* **Resource Stability**: Both systems demonstrated stable memory patterns with no concerning growth trends, confirming the system's suitability for extended operation.

**Conclusions from the Performance Report**

* **Statistical Analysis**: Comprehensive performance metrics across all test types:
  * *Soccer*: 100% success rate across 200 test requests, with an average response time of 3.5 seconds
  * *Basketball*: 100% success rate across 200 test requests, with an average response time of 0.80 seconds (note: this differs from volume test results due to different test configurations)

* **System Reliability**: Zero errors logged across all stress test categories (volume, concurrency, and memory usage), demonstrating robust error handling and system stability.

* **Performance Characteristics**: The system exhibits predictable performance patterns with well-controlled response time distributions and no significant performance degradation under sustained load.

**Conclusions from the Validation Test Results**
The expert system demonstrated solid performance in prediction accuracy. It achieved 70% accuracy in football (7 out of 10 correct recommendations) and 90% accuracy in basketball (9 out of 10). This indicates that the underlying models are well-tuned, particularly for basketball scenarios. The slightly lower accuracy in football suggests an opportunity for refinement, possibly by adjusting how certain variables such as team form or league position are weighted in the reasoning process.

## **Deployment**
The system was deployed as a Telegram bot to maximize accessibility without requiring users to install dedicated applications. The deployment architecture was designed to ensure reliability, availability, and seamless user interaction. 

Users can interact directly with the expert system through the Telegram bot at [https://t.me/BetGuide_Bot](https://t.me/BetGuide_Bot).

### Containerization with Docker
The application was containerized using Docker to ensure consistent behavior across different environments:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN pip install --upgrade pip
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
EXPOSE 10000
ENV FLASK_APP=keepalive.py
ENV FLASK_ENV=production
ENV PORT=10000
CMD ["python", "telegram_bot.py"]
```

This approach encapsulates all dependencies and configurations, making deployment straightforward across various hosting platforms.

### Multi-Service Architecture
The deployment implements two cooperative services running in the same container:

1. **Telegram Bot Service**: Handles all user interactions, processes messages, maintains conversation state, and interfaces with the expert system's core logic:

```python
async def handle_message(update: Update, context: ContextTypes.DEFAULT_TYPE):
    # Process user messages and interact with BettingAdviser
    response = advisers[user_id].get_betting_advice(facts)
    await update.message.reply_text(response["message"])
```

2. **Flask Health Check Service**: A lightweight web server that prevents the container from being terminated by hosting providers that require HTTP traffic:

```python
app = Flask(__name__)
@app.route("/")
def index():
    return "Bot is running!"
```

Both services run concurrently via threading:

```python
flask_thread = threading.Thread(target=run_flask)
flask_thread.daemon = True
flask_thread.start()
```

### State Management
User conversations are maintained through Telegram's context system, storing:

- Current conversation stage
- Collected betting factors
- Next expected user input

This enables personalized, sequential conversations with multiple simultaneous users:

```python
context.user_data["facts"] = facts
context.user_data["next_fact"] = response["next_fact"]
```

### Environment Variable Management
Sensitive configuration values like the Telegram API token are stored in environment variables loaded via dotenv:

```python
load_dotenv()
TOKEN = os.environ.get("TELEGRAM_TOKEN")
```

## **Conclusion and Future Work**

This expert system demonstrates the power of combining symbolic reasoning with probabilistic modeling to simulate expert-level decision-making in a user-friendly, real-time setting. By integrating domain knowledge and formal inference, it bridges the gap between casual betting intuition and data-informed judgment.

### **Future Enhancements**

* Expand to include more sports like tennis or baseball, or make it more specific of which leagues.
* Integrate real-time data feeds (e.g., injury reports, odds).
* Train Bayesian networks on historical datasets instead of manually defining CPDs.
* Add confidence calibration or betting amount recommendations.
